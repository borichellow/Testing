To start tests you should make three sings:

1) start selenium-server. Command: "java -jar seleniumServer/selenium-server-standalone-2.35.0.jar"
2) in new tab of console client run file 'RunAll.php' by phpunit. Command: "phpunit RunAll.php"
   (it`s run file, in which tester will add tests as they become available)
